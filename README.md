# Underwater Paradise
Underwater Paradise is an arcade-style VR shooter in which you have to collect garbage that is thrown into the ocean by using grappling guns and throwing it into the correct recycling bin. The more trash that lands on the ocean floor, the more unhealthy the water color becomes. When too much trash has accumulated on the ocean floor you are game over. How high can you score? Underwater paradise was created as a study project at HTW Berlin.
